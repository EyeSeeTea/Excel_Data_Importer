/*****************************************************************************/

This template allows you to import multiples sheets of monthly data in DHIS2.

The following fields are mandatory in each sheet:
A1: The text "MULTIPLE_DE"

F2: The year of the data (you can merge some cells but the rerefence cell must be F2)
From F3: Any of following values
jan feb mar apr	may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec

You may leave blank the following columns of a month instead of repeating it. The 
App will take in account the first one. (But the first one must be there, on the first column).
(For exemple if you put two data elements per month, you can put "jan" on F3, leave blank G3 and put "feb" on H3)


You may add more years and months on 2nd and 3rd row, the year taken in account for 
a month is the last year indicated (you don't need to repeat the year in each column, 
only once when it changes).

Row 6: (Free text)
Row 5: The CODE of the DataElement (From F in each column)
Row 4: The UID of the Category Combination (From F in each column)

From B7: The code or ID of the OrgUnit. You can choose when importing in the App.

All other fields are free.
